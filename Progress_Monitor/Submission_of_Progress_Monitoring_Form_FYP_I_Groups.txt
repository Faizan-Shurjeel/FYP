Dear Students,

I hope this email finds you well.

The Project Advisory Committee (PAC) has designed a Progress Monitoring Form for all Final Year Projects (FYPs) to systematically record the monthly progress of each project group.

As per the guideline, each FYP group is required to complete this form, obtain their supervisor’s signature, and submit it in the FYP Lab. The submission will be required on the last Friday of every month to ensure consistent progress tracking and timely achievement of project milestones.

Please note that the upcoming submission is due tomorrow, being the last Friday of the month. Faculty supervisors are already informed to kindly guide their respective groups to ensure timely completion and submission of the form.

For your convenience, the template of the Progress Monitoring Form is attached (in both PDF and Word formats). Please fill in the information in the space provided. However, if someone needs extra space, they can attach a separate sheet.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Regards,
Ghulam Abbas
FYP Lab
